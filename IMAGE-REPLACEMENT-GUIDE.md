# 🖼️ PRODUCT IMAGES - ACTION REQUIRED

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Some Product Images Need Replacement

Several product pages are pulling images from external URLs (provia.com, hunterDouglas.com) which may break over time.

---

## 📋 Images That Need Replacement:

### Windows Page:
- Endure Windows image
- Aspect Windows image
- Aeris Windows image

### Doors Page:
- Entry door images
- Patio door images

### Window Treatments Page:
- Hunter Douglas shades images
- Blinds images
- Shutters images

### Awnings Page:
- Aristocrat awning images
- Solar shade images

---

## ✅ How to Fix (2 Options):

### OPTION 1: Upload Through CMS (Recommended)

1. Go to `yoursite.com/admin`
2. Click on the page (e.g., "Windows Page")
3. Click "Windows Content"
4. For each product:
   - Click the image field
   - Upload your own product photo
   - Click "Save"
5. Repeat for all products on all pages

**Time: 15-30 minutes**

---

### OPTION 2: Use Your Own Product Photos

If you have product photos:

1. Go to `/admin`
2. For each product page (Windows, Doors, Treatments, Awnings):
   - Edit the product
   - Upload image from your computer
   - Save

If you DON'T have photos:
- Download from manufacturer websites:
  - ProVia: https://www.provia.com
  - Hunter Douglas: https://www.hunterdouglas.com
  - Aristocrat: https://www.aristocratawnings.com
- Or take photos of products in your showroom

## 📸 Image Requirements:

**Format:** JPG or PNG  
**Size:** 1200x800px recommended  
**File size:** Under 500KB (optimized)  
**Quality:** High resolution, professional

---

## 🎯 Priority Order:

1. **Windows page** (most important)
2. **Doors page**
3. **Window Treatments**
4. **Awnings** (less critical - Aristocrat images more stable)

---

## 💡 Temporary Solution:

The site will still work with external images for now, but plan to replace them within the first week of launch.

---

## ✅ Once Fixed:

After uploading your own images:
- [ ] Windows page - all product images
- [ ] Doors page - all product images
- [ ] Window Treatments - all product images
- [ ] Awnings page - all product images
- [ ] Gallery page - add your project photos

---

**Note:** This is the ONLY remaining task before launch. Everything else is ready!
