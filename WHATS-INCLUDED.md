## 🚧 What Still Needs Work

### 1. Replace External Images ⚠️
**Current Issue:** Product images still pull from external URLs (provia.com, etc) which may break

**Fix Options:**
- **A) Upload through CMS** - Go to each product page in CMS and upload your own images
- **B) I can create placeholder images** - Takes 15 mins
- **C) Use temporary placeholder service** - Works but not ideal

**My Recommendation:** Upload your own product photos through the CMS admin panel

### 2. Blog & FAQ Pages (HTML not created yet)
**What's Ready:**
- ✅ CMS configured for blog posts
- ✅ CMS configured for FAQ items
- ❌ Need to create blog.html (blog listing page)
- ❌ Need to create faq.html (FAQ display page)

**Time to Add:** 30 minutes

### 3. Google Maps API Key
**Current:** Service areas page has placeholder API key

**Fix:** 
1. Get free API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in service-areas.html
3. Or I can show you how

### 4. Schema Markup (Local Business SEO)
**Status:** Not yet added

**What it does:** Shows your business in Google with star ratings, hours, etc.

**Time to Add:** 15 minutes
